        <p><center>Projects are one of the best ways to track the progress of both students and teachers. Students can put their understanding to the test, while teachers can assess how well their lessons are being received. This <b>ONLINE SUBMISSION</b> eliminates the drudgery that comes with grading, and makes creating project a breeze.</center></p>
        <p><center>Sharing content and notes with students is easy and quick with Online Submission. Students can access the study materials as and when they want to. Teachers will have a record of the materials that they have shared and it is easier to track what has been taught and how much is left to be covered.</center</p>
